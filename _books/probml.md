Been working through Kevin Murphy's *Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction" for a bit now, slowly transferring those solutions and notes from all of my notebooks to my acrhives on the site here. Overall, I feel that Murphy's book offers a strong review of math foundations for machine learning before doubling down with a clean, rigorous explaination of fundamental ML algorithms, models, and concepts.

Looking forward to getting through the rest of this one. (I used the cover for another version of his book, since the cover wasn't on OpenLibrary.)
