I picked up a copy of this book a while ago when I saw it at a bookstore. Brian Christian presents a survey and discussion of the issue of alignment and its potential impact on the future. I found its presentation of the the alignment problem interesting, if not a bit dramaticized. It's an interesting account of a silent frontier in AI systems.
