I started reading Baby Rudin alongside my coursework this past semester taking 18.100B at MIT. I deeply appreciated the additional depth and abstraction that Rudin brought to the material, and supplemented a lot of my work throughout the semester with problems from Rudin's book for the sheer elegeance in some of the work.

I picked up a copy of the book to keep in my personal collection.
