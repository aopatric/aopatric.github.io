Really enjoyed this book! Before reading, I felt like some of the gaps in my knowledge were on the side of the practicality and scalability of ML systems, and Chip Huyen's book answered a lot of my questions on the subject. I especially appreciated the in-context examples for the applications of empricially-learned tools and tricks that would otherwise require grinding through issues.

Will update this post at a later date, but really enjoyed this book!
