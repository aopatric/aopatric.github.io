Writing this small blog post right before pushing the first version of my updated site; this blog will serve as a semi-regular checkin to what I'm up to this summer and beyond. As of right now, I'm working on my Obsidian RAG agent, my CSAIL work, and some practice examples from Kevin Murphy's *Probabilistic Machine Learning*. Stay tuned for more updates, and as always feel free to contact for questions and inquiries.
