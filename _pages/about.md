Hi! I'm an undergrad at MIT studying artificial intelligence + decision making. I currently do neurosymbolic reasoning research at CSAIL. 

Previously, I worked at the Media Lab on the Camera Culture group's Project SONAR team where we built decentralized cross-platform training frameworks for edge-device federated learning with data security guarantees.

Before that, I got my first bit of research experience at MIT's Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, where I spent a summer adapting language models for single-cell RNA sequencing data.

Outside of that work, my personal interests are in architectures/foundation models and learning algortihms. Some of my favorite papers include [AlphaGo](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961), [DeepseekMath/GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300), and the recent [V-JEPA 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09985) work.

If I'm not working on one of the above things, I'm probably reading about one of the above things. Otherwise, I'm probably listening to something, playing something, or hanging out with my cat Cillian.

I'm always open to chatting and discussing both research and opportunities, so feel free to reach out!
